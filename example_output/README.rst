Example Output
==============

The files contained within this directory are examples of the PDF output of the
software using a pre-defined seed for the random number generator of the value
"leeds". :-)

The full score is in ``score.pdf`` and each part is obviously named. The
``score.midi`` file will allow you to her the piece with your favourite midi
player but the result is of poor quality at best.
